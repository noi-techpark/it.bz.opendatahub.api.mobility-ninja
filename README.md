## Usage of the API

### I want to see what this API provides

```
GET /
```

### Station and Edge Types / Categories

#### I want to get all station or edge types

The API provides data about nodes and edges on a map. The node is a measurement
station, and the connection between stations are called edges. The first path
variable is the [representation](#representation).

For compactness, we will use only flat representations throughout this tutorial.

Examples:
```
GET /tree,node/
GET /flat,node/
GET /tree,edge/
GET /flat,edge/
GET /tree,event/
GET /flat,event/
```

### Events

We expose all kinds of events, that are labels on the timeline. An event has a
unique ID and corresponding time series UUID, which allows us to concatenate
events into a historical view. Events come from a certain `origin`, for example,
traffic events from the `A22` highway. The prefixes of events are `ev` for the
general information part, and `evl` for its location (could be points, polygons
or multilines).

#### I want to get all event origins available

```
GET /flat,event/
```

#### I want to get all events of a certain origin

```
GET /flat,event/A22
```

#### I want to get the latest events of a certain origin in all eventseries therein

```
GET /flat,event/A22/latest
```

#### I want to get all events that were active on 3rd January 2022

```
GET /flat,event/A22/2022-01-03
```

#### I want to get all events that were active on 3rd January 2022, but not after 2022-02-01

```
GET /flat,event/A22/latest/2022-01-03/2022-02-01
```

### Edges

We expose only **available** edges, but for historical reasons the `eavailable`,
`sbavailable` and `seavailable` fields are still accessible. Availability should
have been an internal-only field to mark a station visible through the API.

An edge is a connection between two stations and some descriptive fields
attached. In addition it contains geometries, that describe the connection on a
map.

An edge is (for historical reasons) internally represented with three stations,
a start station, an end station and a station that represents the description of
the edge. Therefore we have three prefixes of JSON fields:
- fields with prefix `e` are part of the edge descriptions
- fields with prefix `sb` are part of the beginning station
- fields with prefix `se` are part of the ending station

#### I want to get all edges of a certain category

```
GET /flat,edge/Linkstation
```

#### I want to get a specific edge of a certain category

```
/flat,edge/LinkStation?where=ename.eq."tis -> cfirmiano"
```


### Stations

We expose only **available** stations, but for historical reasons the
`savailable` fields are still accessible. Availability should have been an
internal-only field to mark a station visible through the API.

Please note, that the response is limited. However, you can [set another limit
or disable it completely](#pagination).

#### I want to get all e-charging stations including details

```
GET /node,flat/EChargingStation
```
is the same as
```
GET /flat/EChargingStation
```

#### I want to get all e-charging stations and their plugs including details

```
GET /flat/EChargingStation,EChargingPlug
```

As you see an `EChargingStation` is a parent of `EchargingPlug`s, hence we could
avoid duplicate output, by simply fetching only plugs.

```
GET /flat/EChargingPlug
```

#### I want to get all stations of any type including details

```
GET /flat/*
```

### Stations, Data Types and most up-to-date Measurements

#### I want to get all most up-to-date measurements of all parking lots

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/*/latest
```

#### I want to get all most up-to-date occupancy values of all parking lots

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/latest
```

### Stations, Data Types and historical Measurements

The URL pattern is `/station-types/data-types/from/to`, where `from` and `to`
form a half-open interval, i.e., `[from, to)`. This is important, if we want to
have a moving window over a timeline without selecting certain values multiple
times.

#### I want to get historical occupancy values of all parking lots from a certain period

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/2019-01-01/2019-01-02
```

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/2019-01-01T23/2019-01-02
```

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/2019-01-01/2019-01-02T12:30:15
```

The date format is `yyyy-MM-dd` or `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSS`, where
`Thh:mm:ss.SSS` is optional and any part of it can be shortened from
left-to-right to any subset.

### Historical Station metadata
The URL pattern is `/station-types/metadata/from/to`, where `from` and `to`
form a half-open interval, i.e., `[from, to)`.

Note that while metadata looks like a data type in the URL, the data structure is actually different from normal data requests.
Current metadata is still included as smetadata, historical metadata has the prefix "mh"

#### I want to get historical metadata for all bluetooth stations from a certain period
```
GET /tree,node/BluetoothStation/metadata/2019-01-01/2023-01-02
```

```
GET /tree,node/BluetoothStation/metadata/2019-01-01T23/2023-01-02
```

```
GET /flat/BluetoothStation/metadata/2019-01-01/2023-01-02T12:30:15
```

The date format is `yyyy-MM-dd` or `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSS`, where
`Thh:mm:ss.SSS` is optional and any part of it can be shortened from
left-to-right to any subset.

### Pagination

You can limit your output by adding `limit` to your request, and paginate your
results with an `offset`. If you want to disable the limit, set it to a negative
number, like `limit=-1`. Per default, the limit is set to a low number to
prevent excessive response times.

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/2019-01-01/2019-01-02?limit=100&offset=300
```

### Filtering with SELECT and WHERE

It is possible to filter against JSON fields (columns in a database) with
`select=alias,alias,alias,...`, or per record (rows in a database) with
`where=filter,filter,filter,...`. The latter, is a conjunction (`and`) of all
clauses. Also complex logic is possible, with nested `or(...)` and `and(...)`
clauses, for instance `where=or(filter,filter,and(filter,filter))`.

**alias**
An `alias` is a list of point-separated-fields, where each field corresponds
to a step inside the JSON hierarchy. Internally, the first field represents the
database column and all subsequent fields drill into the JSON hierarchy.
For example, `metadata.municipality.cap` is an JSONB inside the database with a
column `metadata` and a JSONB object called `municipality` which has a `cap`
inside.

**filter**
A `filter` has the form `alias.operator.value_or_list`.

**value_or_list**

- `value`: Whatever you want, also a regular expression. Use double-quotes to
  force string recognition. Alternatively, you can escape characters `,`, `'`
  and `"` with a `\`. Use url-encoding, if your tool does not support certain
  characters. Special values are `null`, numbers and omitted values. Examples:
  - `description.eq.null`, checks if a description is not set
  - `description.eq.`, checks if a description is a string of length 0
- `list`: `(value,value,value)`

**operator**

- `eq`: Equal
- `neq`: Not Equal
- `lt`: Less Than
- `gt`: Greater Than
- `lteq`: Less Than Or Equal
- `gteq`: Greater Than Or Equal
- `re`: Regular Expression
- `ire`: Insensitive Regular Expression
- `nre`: Negated Regular Expression
- `nire`: Negated Insensitive Regular Expression
- `bbi`: Bounding box intersecting objects (e.g. a street that is only partially
  covered by the box)
- `bbc`: Bounding box containing objects (e.g. a station or street, that is
  completely covered by the box)
- `dlt`: Within distance from point (e.g. all stations within a 5 km radius from point X)   
    [Learn more and see examples.](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Time-series-API-filter-operators#dlt-operator)
- `in`: True, if the value of the alias can be found within the given list.
  Example: `name.in.(Patrick,Rudi,Peter)`
- `nin`: False, if the value of the alias can be found within the given list.
  Example: `name.nin.(Patrick,Rudi,Peter)`

**logical operations**

- `and(filter,filter,...)`: Conjunction of filters (can be nested)
- `or(filter,filter,...)`: Disjunction of filters (can be nested)

Multiple conditions possible as comma-separated-values.

Example-syntax for `bbi` or `bbc` could be `coordinate.bbi.(11,46,12,47,4326)`, where
the ordering inside the list is left-x, left-y, right-x, right-y and SRID
(optional).

NB: Currently it is not possible to distinguish between a JSON field containing `null`
or a non-existing JSON field.

#### I want to see only station names, data type names and the value of the measurement

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/2019-01-01/2019-01-02?select=sname,tname,mvalue
```

#### I want to see only parking stations within a bounding box of a map

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/*?where=scoordinate.bbi.(11.63,46.0,11.65,47.0,4326)
```

... I want now to add to that query two additional stations (ex., 69440GW and AB3), that I
need regardless, if they are within the bounding box or not.

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/*?where=or(scoordinate.bbi.(11.63,46.0,11.65,47.0,4326),scode.in.(69440GW,AB3))
```

#### I want to see all information where the measured value is greater than 100 and the station origin is FAMAS

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/2019-01-01/2019-01-02?where=mvalue.gt.100,sorigin.eq.FAMAS
```

Here the syntax for each clause is `attribute.operator.value`, where value can
be composed of any character except `,'"`, which must be escaped like `\,`, `\'`
or `\"`. A special value is `null`. If you want to use it as a literal value,
that is, the String itself, then you must put it into double-quotes, like
`"null"`.

#### I want all creative industry station names, which do not have a sector assigned

We use a JSON selector and JSON filters here:

```
GET /flat/CreativeIndustry?where=smetadata.sector.eq.null&select=sname
```

#### I want to see all information where the station code starts with "me" or "rovereto"

We use a key-insensitive regular expression here:

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/2019-01-01/2019-01-02?where=scode.ire.(ME|Rovereto)
```

#### I want active creative industry stations with their sector and website, but only if the have one

We use a JSON selector and JSON filters here:

```
GET /flat/CreativeIndustry?where=sactive.eq.true,smetadata.website.neq.null,smetadata.website.ire."http"&select=sname,smetadata.sector,smetadata.website
```

We check not only for `smetadata.website` to be present, but also to start with `http` to be sure it
is not a description telling us, that the website is currently under development or similar things.

### Time Zones

We use UTC as default time zone, but it is now possible to get timestamp
reponses in any timezone. Use `timezone=Europe/Rome` for instance. See
[java.time.ZoneId](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html)
for details. If the browser replaces `+` with spaces, the API tries to insert
`+` again, and searches then for matching zone IDs.

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/latest?timezone=UTC-2
```

Please note, that `metadata`
are kept as is, date or time representations inside it are stored as simple
strings, and therefore not recognized as date or time.

### Null values

You can also see null-values within JSON, by adding `shownull=true` to your parameter list.

```
GET /flat/ParkingStation/occupied/2019-01-01/2019-01-02?shownull=true
```

### Representation

We have various types of representations to choose from. Separate each type with
commas:
- type #1: `flat` or `tree`
- type #2: `node`, `edge` or `event` (`node` is the default and can be omitted)

The flat one shows each JSON object with all selected attributes at the first
level. Deeper levels represent complex data types, such as `coordinates` and
`jsonb`. Only the first level can be selected or filtered.

Example with `select=stype,tname,mvalue,smetadata`:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "stype": "ParkingStation",
      "tname": "occupied",
      "mvalue": 300,
      "smetadata": {
        "capacity": 1200,
        "...": "..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the station type `stype` and the data type `tname` are on the
same level within the JSON object. These are first order attributes, whereas
`smetadata` is a `jsonb`-typed column.

If you want to retrieve only subsets of information, like `all data types`,
which do not match inside a hierarchy, this representation is suited for you.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "tname": "ParkingStation"
    },
    {
      "tname": "VMS"
    },
    {
      "tname": "EChargingStation"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `tree` representation, shows a hierarchy of the following kind for nodes:

```
station types / categories
└── stations (incl. parent and metadata)
    ├── data types
    │   └── measurements
    └── metadatahistory
```

...and the following hierarchy for edges:
```
edge types / categories
└── edges (incl. start and end station)
```

...whereas, events have this hierarchy:
```
event origins
└── event series uuids
    └── event uuids
```


NB: The `tree` is more expensive to generate on the server and to use within
your application, but the response size can be much smaller due to nesting and
thus duplicate attribute elimination. However, some queries do not match that
hierarchy, so the `flat` representation is more suited for them.

### Quota

It is possible to configure a maximum request per second quota, depending on
various constraints. Currently, we support these quota profiles:

name      | description                                             | .properties key
----------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------
Anonymous | not logged in and no referer header                     | ninja.quota.guest
Referer   | referer header send                                     | ninja.quota.referer
Basic     | Bearer Token containing a BASIC role, or no role at all | ninja.quota.basic
Advanced  | Bearer Token containing a ADVANCED role                 | ninja.quota.advanced
Premium   | Bearer Token containing a PREMIUM role                  | ninja.quota.premium
Admin     | Bearer Token containing the ADMIN role                  | *no key / no quota*

In addition, the `ninja.quota.url` property should contain a link to a
[webpage](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Api-Quota), that
explains what the `429` HTTP error code means.

Roles must be set as follows in Keycloak:
1) Open your Keycloak server
2) Go to clients and open `odh-mobility-v2` in your clients section
3) Under `Roles` add these roles:
   - `ODH_ROLE_BASIC`: Open Data Hub Pricing Policy: Basic (if logged in and
     roles are missing, this is the DEFAULT)
   - `ODH_ROLE_ADVANCED`: Open Data Hub Pricing Policy: Advanced
   - `ODH_ROLE_PREMIUM`: Open Data Hub Pricing Policy: Premium
   - `ODH_ROLE_ADMIN`: Open Data Hub Pricing Policy: Administrator = no
     restrictions at all (only used internally)

The role prefix is `ODH_ROLE_` for quota related roles, and `BDP_` for
row-level-security or open/closed data definition roles.

There should be at least one row-level-security role called `BDP_ADMIN`, this
role should be a composite role with `ODH_ROLE_ADMIN`. This means, that if one
is activated also the other one will be activated. `BDP_ADMIN` implies that this
role can see all data, and `ODH_ROLE_ADMIN` removes all quota restrictions from
those calls.

See [How to register this application in your local authentication
server?](#how-to-register-this-application-in-your-local-authentication-server)
for further details.

We limit rates through a token-bucket algorithm. We identify a rate-limit bucket
with keys build as explained inside the method [RateLimitInterceptor/resolveBucket](src/main/java/it/bz/idm/bdp/ninja/quota/RateLimitInterceptor.java).

### Authentication

We use a token based authentication (JWT) which can be retrieved from an OAuth
2.0 server.

#### I want to retrieve protected measurements (closed data)

NB: Swagger does not support authentication yet, therefore we provide a `curl`
example.

```sh
curl -X GET "https://example.com/tree/VMS/*" \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer header.payload.signature'
```

### Additional Sample Queries

For better readability, we assume that all queries are configured as follows, if
not otherwise stated: `shownull=false&distinct=true&limit=-1`.

NB: We need to count results on application level, because the API does
currently not support aggregation, like `count` and other statistical methods
involving `grouping`.

#### show all echarging stations of bolzano

```
GET /flat/EChargingStation?where=sactive.eq.true,scoordinate.bbi.(11.27539,46.444913,11.432577,46.530384)
```

#### Show number of public, private and private with public access echarging stations

Since we want to count the results later, we need to set `distinct=false`.

```
GET /flat/EChargingStation?select=smetadata.accessType&where=sactive.eq.true&distinct=false
```

#### Show the total number of plugs and how many are currently available

This means that the measured value `mvalue` must be equal `1`.

```
GET /flat/EChargingPlug/*?select=scode&where=sactive.eq.true,tname.eq.echarging-plug-status,mvalue.eq.1
```

#### Filter EchargingPlugs by voltage

```
GET /flat/EChargingPlug?where=sactive.eq.true
```

#### Filter EchargingStations by payment method

```
GET /flat/EChargingStation?where=sactive.eq.true,smetadata.accessType.eq.PUBLIC
```

#### Get all possible states of all echarging stations

```
GET /flat/EChargingStation?select=smetadata.state
```

#### Filter EchargingStations by state

For example filter against `ACTIVE` states.

```
GET /flat/EChargingPlug?where=sactive.eq.true,smetadata.state.eq.ACTIVE
```

----
## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 1.8 or higher (e.g. [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/))
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x
- Run [NOI Authentication server] locally or connect to test environment
  (optional)

[NOI Authentication server]: https://github.com/noi-techpark/authentication-server

### Getting started

Create `local` application properties profile.

```bash
cd src/main/resources
touch application-local.properties
```

Configure at least the mandatory properties in the newly created `application-local.properties` file, such as:

- spring.datasource.password

Now you can start the application with:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

The server will startup and listen on `http://localhost:8081`.

### How to setup NOI Authentication Server locally? (optional)

- [Here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/authentication-server) you can find how to run the server locally
- Create a new realm following these [steps](https://github.com/noi-techpark/authentication-server/blob/master/docs/noi-authentication-server.md#realm)

#### How to register this application in your local authentication server?

1. Open the previously created realm
2. Create a new client (Clients -> Create)

| Property | Value           |

### REUSE

This project is [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compliant, more information about the usage of REUSE in NOI Techpark repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Guidelines-for-developers-and-licenses#guidelines-for-contributors-and-new-developers).

Since the CI for this project checks for REUSE compliance you might find it useful to use a pre-commit hook checking for REUSE compliance locally. The [pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file in the repository root is already configured to check for REUSE compliance with help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool.

Install the tool by running:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
Then install the pre-commit hook via the config file by running:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
